# Pokemon-Go-Discord-Bot-Helper
Simple discord bot that can respond with type charts and relationships, as well as basic stats for Pokemon GO. 

Commands:
- !dex (pokemon name): searches for a pokemon within pokemon GOs database and returns its stats
- !type (pokemon type): returns the requested type with its advantageous and disadvantageous relationships to other types
- !typechart: returns complete type relationship chart

Future updates:
- Automatically post updates from the official Pokemon GO social medias, as well as credible fan sources
- Allow users to upload their pokemon to the bot under their discord names and rate teams for raid battles
- Allow users to search for specific raid pokemon and strategies

Notes:
- Typing 'Yun', 'Yang' or 'Daniel' will prompt the bot to reply to you with something. Inside joke with my friends :)
